STM32 development board, designed within the Raspberry Pi Pico footprint.

## Getting Started

A pinout for the board is provided in `documentation`, and example projects are provided in `firmware`. To build an example using CMake/VSCode:
- Clone the repo
- Import the project with the STM32Cube extension
- Configure the build options when prompted (Debug/Release)
- Configure as default and run the Build+Flash task with the STLink attached to the board
